# Deep-Learning-for-remote-sensing-lulc-classification-Unveiling-the-insights-with-SHAP



## Overview
LULC-DeepSHAP is a Python-based deep learning framework for **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification** using remote sensing imagery.  
It combines efficient CNN architectures with **Deep SHAP** interpretability to analyze model decisions, demonstrating effectiveness on the **EuroSAT dataset**.

## Features
- Compact and efficient CNN model for LULC classification.
- Interpretability using **Deep SHAP**, visualizing model decisions.
- Works with remote sensing imagery datasets (e.g., EuroSAT).
- Designed for possible extension with **Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs)** for real-time learning.
